Results on correlation between popOver65 and veterans
State data for Pop over 65 and veterans: 
REGION demographic statistics:
stats mean X: 0.15 size of vector: 51
stats mean Y: 0.07 size of vector: 51
std dev mean X: 1.80
std dev mean Y: 1.35
Population Coeff: 0.24

From this lab, we explored the relationship between population over 65 and veterans and found a rather weak positive correlation, which suggests that although
there is some veterans over 65, most veterans are likely younger.
